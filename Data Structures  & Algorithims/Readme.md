# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Journey 🚀

## 🌟 About This Repository

This repository is my **personal record of learning and mastery in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

It serves as a comprehensive collection of my **findings, implementations, and problem-solving solutions** from various coding challenges and educational resources. Think of it as a live notebook tracking my journey to writing more efficient and optimized code.

## 💡 Introduction to DSA

**Data Structures** are specialized ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data.

**Algorithms** are a set of well-defined instructions or steps to solve a particular problem.

Mastering DSA is crucial for software development as it directly impacts the **efficiency** (time and space complexity) and **scalability** of a program.

## 🗃️ Data Structures Listing

Data structures are generally classified based on how elements are organized and accessed.

### 1. Linear Data Structures
Elements are arranged sequentially, and each element has a unique predecessor and successor (except the first and last).

| Data Structure | Description | Key Operations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Array** | Collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. | Access, Insert, Delete. |
| **Linked List** | Collection of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. | Insertion, Deletion, Traversal. |
| **Stack** | LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure. | Push, Pop, Peek. |
| **Queue** | FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure. | Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek. |

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
Elements are not arranged sequentially; instead, elements are connected to multiple other elements in a complex way.

| Data Structure | Description | Use Cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tree** | Hierarchical structure with a root node and children nodes (e.g., Binary Tree, AVL Tree, B-Tree). | File systems, database indexing. |
| **Graph** | A set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. | Social networks, mapping, network topology. |
| **Hash Table (Map/Dictionary)** | Stores data in key-value pairs; uses a hash function for fast data retrieval. | Caching, symbol table in compilers. |
| **Heap** | A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property (Max or Min Heap). | Priority Queues, Heap Sort. |
