# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (methods).

---

## Why Use OOP?

- **Modularity:** Code is organized into objects, making it easier to manage.
- **Reusability:** Objects and classes can be reused across programs.
- **Scalability:** Programs can be expanded with new objects without changing existing code.
- **Maintainability:** Clear structure makes debugging and updates easier.
- **Real-world Modeling:** Objects represent real-world entities, making design intuitive.

## Essential OOP Concepts (Types)

| Term             | Definition                                                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Class**        | A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviors that the created objects will have. |
| **Object**       | An instance of a class. Represents a real-world entity with state (attributes) and behavior (methods).     |
| **Encapsulation**| Wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit, and restricting access to some components. |
| **Inheritance**  | Mechanism where one class (child/subclass) inherits attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). |
| **Polymorphism** | Ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance, usually by method overriding or overloading. |
| **Abstraction**  | Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object to the outside world. |

## Summary of OOP Types

- **Class and Object:** Foundation of OOP; classes define, objects implement.
- **Encapsulation:** Protects object integrity by hiding internal data.
- **Inheritance:** Enables hierarchical class relationships and code reuse.
- **Polymorphism:** Allows flexibility by letting objects behave differently based on context.
- **Abstraction:** Simplifies interaction by exposing only essential information.

## Conclusion

OOP is widely used in modern programming because it models real-world concepts easily, facilitates code reuse, and makes software easier to maintain and scale. Learning these core OOP principles is essential for becoming a proficient programmer.
