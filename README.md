## ☕ Introduction to Java

Java is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.  
It’s known for its **simplicity, reliability, and platform independence**.  

- **Object-Oriented** → Everything in Java revolves around classes and objects.  
- **Platform Independent** → Code runs anywhere with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  
- **Secure & Robust** → Java is designed with security features and strong memory management.  
- **Versatile** → From mobile apps (Android) to large-scale enterprise systems, Java is everywhere.  

In simple words, Java is like a *universal toolkit* for programmers — once you learn it, you can apply it to almost any area of software development.
